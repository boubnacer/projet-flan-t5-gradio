# ðŸ¤– FLAN-T5 Gradio RAG â€“ Retrieval-Augmented Generation with FLAN-T5

This project demonstrates a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the `google/flan-t5` model for answering user questions based on uploaded documents. It uses **sentence-transformers** for embedding text, **FAISS** for similarity search, and a **Gradio** web interface for interaction.
